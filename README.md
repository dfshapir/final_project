# Russian Regional Demographic Change

This project analyzes Russia's demographic change by region from the early 1990s to 2010. The project breaks down various aspects of demographic statistics and provides a mixture of interpretive maps and interactive plots to allow the viewer to get an in-depth view of Russia's demographic trends over the given time period. I also form conclusions as to the implications that this data has for Russia's current demographic crisis and potential future trends.

# Data

I used two data sets for this project. One was the University of Michigan's ICPSR data for Russia. Link: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/35355/datadocumentation#

The other was GADM's basic shapefile data: https://gadm.org/data.html

The first dataset requires organizational permission to access.

# About Me

My name is Daniel Shapiro, and I'm a master's student in the REECA (Regional Studies: Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia) program at Harvard's Davis Center. I study contemporary Russian politics and economics, as well as the geopolitics of the Caucasus. This project accompanies an article that I wrote on demographics in Russia and is my final project for GOV 1005 at Harvard.
