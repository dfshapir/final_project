# Russian Regional Demographic Change

This project analyzes Russia's demographic change by region from the early 1990s to 2010. The project breaks down various aspects of demographic statistics and provides a mixture of interpretive maps and interactive plots to allow the viewer to get an in-depth view of Russia's demographic trends over the given time period. I also form conclusions as to the implications that this data has for Russia's current demographic crisis and potential future trends.
